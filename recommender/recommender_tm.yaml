abuse_cases:
  Adversarial Examples: >
    As an attacker, I want to craft adversarial inputs to manipulate the recommendations provided by the system, promoting specific products or degrading the quality of recommendations.
  Data Poisoning: >
    As an attacker, I want to introduce malicious data during training to corrupt the model's behavior and outputs.
  Model Extraction: >
    As an attacker, I want to replicate the recommender system model by making repeated queries to the system and analyzing the outputs to create a similar model.
  Training Data Inversion: >
    As an attacker, I want to reconstruct the training data from the model to gain access to sensitive information about user preferences and behavior.
  Evasion Attacks: >
    As an attacker, I want to modify input data slightly to avoid detection or influence the recommendations without triggering security mechanisms.
  Model Inversion: >
    As an attacker, I want to infer sensitive attributes about the training data used by the recommender system.
  Privacy Attack: >
    As an attacker, I want to extract personally identifiable information (PII) or other sensitive data from the model's responses, violating user privacy.
  Collaborative Filtering Manipulation: >
    As an attacker, I want to inject fake profiles or manipulate user-item interactions to bias the collaborative filtering recommendations.

security_requirements:
  Input Validation: Ensure strict validation of all input data to prevent injection attacks and data corruption.
  Authentication: Implement strong authentication mechanisms to protect against unauthorized access.
  Data Encryption: Encrypt sensitive data both in transit and at rest to protect against data breaches.
  Access Controls: Enforce strict access controls to limit exposure of sensitive data and system components.
  Anomaly Detection: Implement monitoring and anomaly detection to identify and respond to unusual activities that may indicate an ongoing attack.
  Privacy Protection: Apply techniques such as differential privacy to safeguard user data from being inferred or extracted from the model's outputs.
  Adversarial Training: Incorporate adversarial training techniques to enhance the model's robustness against adversarial examples.
  Model Monitoring: Continuously monitor the model's performance to detect and mitigate potential adversarial attacks and data drift.
  Secure Training Data: Ensure the integrity and confidentiality of the training data to prevent data poisoning and other attacks.
